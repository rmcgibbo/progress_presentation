title={Investigating how peptide length and a pathogenic mutation modify the structural ensemble of amyloid beta monomer.},
author={Lin, Y. and Bowman, G.R. and Beauchamp, K.A. and Pande, V.S.},
journal={Biophys. J.},
volume={102},
number={2},
pages={315-24},
year={2012},
abstract={The aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides plays an important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Despite extensive effort, it has been difficult to characterize the secondary and tertiary structure of the Aβ monomer, the starting point for aggregation, due to its hydrophobicity and high aggregation propensity. Here, we employ extensive molecular dynamics simulations with atomistic protein and water models to determine structural ensembles for Aβ(42), Aβ(40), and Aβ(42)-E22K (the Italian mutant) monomers in solution. Sampling of a total of >700 microseconds in all-atom detail with explicit solvent enables us to observe the effects of peptide length and a pathogenic mutation on the disordered Aβ monomer structural ensemble. Aβ(42) and Aβ(40) have crudely similar characteristics but reducing the peptide length from 42 to 40 residues reduces β-hairpin formation near the C-terminus. The pathogenic Italian E22K mutation induces helix formation in the region of residues 20-24. This structural alteration may increase helix-helix interactions between monomers, resulting in altered mechanism and kinetics of Aβ oligomerization. }

@article{Karplus:2002wt,
    abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are important tools for understanding the physical basis of the structure and function of biological macromolecules. The early view of proteins as relatively rigid structures has been replaced by a dynamic model in which the internal motions and resulting conformational changes play an essential role in their function. This review presents a brief description of the origin and early uses of biomolecular simulations. It then outlines some recent studies that illustrate the utility of such simulations and closes with a discussion of their ever-increasing potential for contributing to biology.}},

abstract ={Characterizing the equilibrium ensemble of folding pathways, including their relative probability, is one of the major challenges in protein folding theory today. Although this information is in principle accessible via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, it is difficult to compute in practice because protein folding is a rare event and the affordable simulation length is typically not sufficient to observe an appreciable number of folding events, unless very simplified protein models are used. Here we present an approach that allows for the reconstruction of the full ensemble of folding pathways from simulations that are much shorter than the folding time. This approach can be applied to all-atom protein simulations in explicit solvent. It does not use a predefined reaction coordinate but is based on partitioning the state space into small conformational states and constructing a Markov model between them. A theory is presented that allows for the extraction of the full ensemble of transition pathways from the unfolded to the folded configurations. The approach is applied to the folding of a PinWW domain in explicit solvent where the folding time is two orders of magnitude larger than the length of individual simulations. The results are in good agreement with kinetic experimental data and give detailed insights about the nature of the folding process which is shown to be surprisingly complex and parallel. The analysis reveals the existence of misfolded trap states outside the network of efficient folding intermediates that significantly reduce the folding speed.},

    abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>A complete description of complex polymers, such as proteins, includes information about their structure and their dynamics. In particular it is of utmost importance to answer the following questions: What are the structural conformations possible? Is there any relevant hierarchy among these conformers? What are the transition paths between them? These and other questions can be addressed by analyzing in an efficient way the Free Energy Landscape of the system. With this knowledge, several problems about biomolecular reactions (such as enzymatic activity, protein folding, protein deposition diseases, etc.) can be tackled. In this article we show how to efficiently describe the Free Energy Landscape for small and large peptides. By mapping the trajectories of molecular dynamics simulations into a graph (the Conformational Markov Network) and unveiling its structural organization, we obtain a coarse grained description of the protein dynamics across the Free Energy Landscape in terms of the relevant kinetic magnitudes of the system. Therefore, we show the way to bridge the gap between the microscopic dynamics and the macroscopic kinetics by means of a mesoscopic description of the associated Conformational Markov Network. Along this path the compromise between the physical nature of the process and the magnitudes that characterize the network is carefully kept to assure the reliability of the results shown.</p>
